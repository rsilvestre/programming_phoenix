## Purpose

The application will allow us to take videos (hosted elsewhere) wnd attach comments to them in real time and play them back alongside the comments of other users. This application will be tremendously demanding because each user will record and play back comments that must be saved and served quickly so that the content stays relavant.

## Start

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
